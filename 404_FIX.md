# 🔧 404 Error Fixed!

## ✅ What I Did:

Updated `vercel.json` to properly route all requests to `index.html` for the Single Page Application (SPA).

## 📋 What You Need to Do:

### Step 1: Vercel Will Auto-Redeploy
Since you connected GitHub to Vercel, it will automatically redeploy when it detects the new commit.

**Wait 2-3 minutes** for the automatic deployment.

### Step 2: If Auto-Deploy Doesn't Work

Go to Vercel:
1. Click on your project
2. Go to **Deployments**
3. Click **...** (three dots) on the latest deployment
4. Click **"Redeploy"**
5. Wait 2-3 minutes

### Step 3: Test Your App

Visit your Vercel URL: `https://code2-placement.vercel.app`

You should now see:
- ✅ Homepage loads
- ✅ No 404 error
- ✅ Can navigate to different pages

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed:

### Before (Caused 404):
```json
{
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/client/dist/$1" }
  ]
}
```
This tried to find exact files, causing 404 for routes.

### After (Fixed):
```json
{
  "routes": [
    { "src": "/api/(.*)", "dest": "/server/api/index.js" },
    { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/client/dist/index.html" }
  ]
}
```
This routes everything to `index.html`, letting React Router handle routing.

## ⚠️ Don't Forget:

After the app is working, you still need to:

1. **Add `CLIENT_URL` environment variable**
   - Go to Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add `CLIENT_URL` with your Vercel URL
   - Redeploy

2. **Test all features:**
   - Register/Login
   - DSA Topics
   - Code Editor
   - Admin Panel

---

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Wait for auto-redeploy** (2-3 minutes)
2. **Refresh your Vercel URL**
3. **Should see homepage!** ✅
4. **Add CLIENT_URL**
5. **Redeploy one more time**
6. **Done!** 🎉

---

## 📞 If Still Getting 404:

1. Check Vercel deployment logs
2. Make sure build succeeded
3. Check that `client/dist/index.html` exists
4. Try manual redeploy

The fix is pushed to GitHub, Vercel should pick it up automatically! 🚀
